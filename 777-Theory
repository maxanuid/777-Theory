Title: The Thought System and Path to Self-Sufficiency

The practical 777 theory is a tool for intelligent, low-risk decision-making in real-life situations and consists of three main components:
7 Sins: Raw actions that can harm oneself or others.
7 Virtuous Acts: Values and positive actions that can sometimes be blind or reckless.
7 Logical Acts: A combination of sins and virtuous acts that suggests the most rational course of action with minimal harm. The 7 Logical Acts function like the brain of the system, guiding decision-making.
Symbolic Explanation:
The number 7 and these categories are purely symbolic and not religious; they represent innate raw actions and subjective value judgments, and they are not strictly limited to seven. This choice is made purely for simplification and conceptual clarity.
Practical Example:
A group of people is harming another person:
Sin says: "Ignore it, don’t get involved."
Virtuous Act says: "Go help, no matter the risk."
Logical Act says: "Find a few people, explain the situation to them, and then solve the problem."
(In 777, the specific actions are never identical, and this system helps you evaluate and analyze decisions while maintaining values and minimizing harm. The 60–40 logic in the logical act means that in 60% of cases the action will succeed, while in 40% of cases, even with the most logical methods, errors are possible, because experience and conditions are always variable.)
The 777 principle demonstrates that intelligent and balanced action is the best way to make decisions in real-life situations and serves as a practical tool for building a path to self-sufficiency and responsible living.
